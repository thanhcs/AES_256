[Program 4]
[Description]
There are 6 java files: In XXX.java, We implemented some functions, e.g. .... Johnny wrote function/method A, B, C. Brad wrote function/method D, E, F. The most important method is A, which has four main steps : 1..., 2..., 3..., 4... To compile our program, you need to use "javac *.java". To run our program, you need to use "java SecureSystem instructionList"

[Finish]
We finished the most/half/one quarter of this assignment. There are some bugs in function/method A in XXX.java file. Some special test cases won't work, the reason is ... For YYY.java, we don't know how to implement the sort method.
